# libre-wsdl4j - A fork of WSDL4J 1.6.3.

Libre-wsdl4j is a fork of WSDL4J 1.6.3. WSL4j is a Java stub generator for WSDL. Many software projects still depends on WSL4j, so the idea is that libre-wsdl4j should be an actively maintained version of this software on GitHub.

## Use libre-wsdl4j as Maven dependency

Add this to your pom.xml file to use the latest version of OpenPDF: (Now on Maven Central!)

```xml

<dependency>
  <groupId>io.github.librewsdl4j</groupId>
  <artifactId>libre-wsdl4j</artifactId>
  <version>1.11.0</version>
</dependency> 
```

The master branch on GitHub requires Java 17 or later.  (libre-wsdl4j 1.11.0 requires Java 11.)

Pull requests welcome! The last release of the original WSDL4J was in Feb, 2013.

WSDL4J is described as "The Web Services Description Language for Java Toolkit (WSDL4J) allows the creation, representation, and manipulation of WSDL documents. It is the reference implementation for JSR110 'JWSDL'", by the original authors.
